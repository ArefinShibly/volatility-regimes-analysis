# Quantitative Research: Asset Interdependencies & Volatility Regimes
**An Econometric Study on Market Dynamics (2015–2024)**

## 📑 Research Overview
This repository hosts a comprehensive research project focused on the non-linear behavior of financial markets. As a **Master’s graduate in Banking and Insurance**, I conducted this study to investigate how correlations between 12 major asset classes—including G10 currencies and precious metals—shift during various market "regimes."

The work demonstrates that "Safe Haven" assets like Gold do not maintain static relationships with the market, but rather exhibit dynamic interdependencies that are highly sensitive to volatility clusters.

## 🔬 Core Research Findings
The research papers included in this repository (found in the `/Volatility regime Analysis/` folder) cover several critical domains:

* **Volatility Clustering:** Implementation of **GARCH models** to analyze the "persistence" of market shocks across a 10-year horizon.
* **Safe-Haven Hypothesis:** Technical testing of Gold and Silver's correlation with USD pairs during high-stress regimes.
* **Portfolio Optimization:** Analysis of **Sharpe, Treynor, and Jensen’s Alpha** metrics to evaluate risk-adjusted performance across different market cycles.
* **Fixed Income Sensitivity:** Detailed research into **Bond Duration and Convexity**, focusing on interest rate volatility and credit migration.

## 🛠 Methodology & Tools
* **Econometrics:** Stationary time-series analysis using daily log returns to eliminate heteroskedasticity.
* **Risk Modeling:** Calculation of **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** and **Expected Shortfall (ES)** to account for "Fat Tail" risks (Kurtosis).
* **Programming:** Python-based implementation using `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and the `Arch` library for advanced econometric modeling.

**Key Findings:**
- 66.7% of pairs (44/66) show statistically significant correlation shifts (p < 0.05)
- USD pairs: positive correlations **increase** during high volatility
- Gold/silver: correlations become **negative** (safe-haven effect)
